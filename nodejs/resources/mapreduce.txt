map reduce
    inside map reduce function
        you can not interact with node js

    aggreate total
        update - > how to remove old value
        delete -> row has been deleted
            we may have to run this in before ?????

        voucher has multiple line items
            and we have to run map reduce on voucher line item


before job
    validation
    before  : this......
    validation should be on a single record
    we do not require validation across validation
    we will not provide query in before ..........

    syntax like db.query.......


transform function
    for voucher
        key column

        can be run for single record
        can be run with cron job

        business operation do not require query operation

        whether table job can be achieved using this .......

        For aggreagete

        day week month year

        memory fast

        they used BSON, which is super fast

        map
        reduce ->it will be used by aggregate for old value also, thats why
