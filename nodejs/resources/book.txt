We need support for aggregate module so that if we pass a date and columns then it will give us aggregate
    calculate  year, month, day and return us

If some voucher inserted/updated deleted ==> day ==>, month ==> year will be calculated again

Need to add a row in data : upon calculate and then add a column closing balance.
we have to iterate data in after query

We can use account group total
    Total for opening balance and given date


WE HAVE TO KEEP AGGREGATE FOR (YEAR | MONTH | DAY) for ACCOUNT, ACCOUNTGROUP
We can use same table but have to keep a column span --> day, month, year every month and year will have start date saved for that column

irrespect of old or delete value
--> we can use map reduce for aggregates run aggregate for
--> when map reduce is running, application will go in non operate mode
----> we can run map reduce one time for each day, user can manually trigger this event with time(day, month or year)

IF we do some changes in old records -> and table is aggregate enable, then we have to keep some variable where we need to run map reduce job for that day
doing this, if no changes done in a day, then no map reduce will fire for that day
