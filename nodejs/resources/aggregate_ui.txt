aggregate in table

aggregate will come in data

display table row on this basis

show aggregate unit :
    Hrs  Minutes
Do we need to show duration in other column also

===>
    Data Model will listen data
        check which data get changed

        check if column has aggregate

        get old value
        get new vlaue
        calculate aggregate

        case should be considered for nested table

            ==> Show aggregate , then do work for currency conversion ==> assuming conversion value is available at client side
==============
    Server side
        task        owner   estimatedhrs        completedhrs
        A           Rohit   12 hrs              1 day
        B           Rohit   1 Day               12 Hrs

        {
        table : tasks
        columns [{expressionestimated : hrs, aggregate:sum},{expression:completehrs, aggregate:sum}]
        }

        type of expressionestimated
            number
            currency
            duration
                estimatedhrs.time
                estimatedhrs.timeunit

        db.tasks.aggregate(
        [ {match query}
          {$project:{$estimatedhrs.timeunit:1,$estimatedhrs.time :1}}
          { $group : {
                       _id : "$estimatedhrs.timeunit", "completedhrs.timeunit"
                       total : { $sum : "$estimatedhrs.time" }
            } },


         ]




          12 hrs
          2 days
          60 minutes

          ==> convert to hrs
             ==>



         completehrs : 24 hrs, estimatdhrs : 24 hrs



        voucher
            vli : object
                vli.debit : currency
                vli.credit  :currency

        query:
            table : vouchers
            columns : sr.no, date, narration, vli:[{},{}]
            moduleparameters:{
                aggregates:
            }



===============================================================================================================================
Order by components

Query : orders will come on data : []

column header will be binding with meta data with some order by expression : if that get chagnes so will it

Order components
    Lookup with option showing labels of all columns
    Asc /Desc box

orders values will be there
    expression ==> we will find label for them

    Save ==>
        Put values in data model and then ...............

===============================================================================================================================
Flex Field
    UI --> its column will be
    Accountid
    accountid.telephoneno
    accountid.checkno
    accountid.billdate

    Data model will monitor value change
        ==> value changes and get column value
            ==> it is flex field ==> then we will remove previous columns and add new columns
            ==> how to do it in panel
              ==> panel binding need to be considered
    Single column will be there in table for flex field
        UI -> Popup box with single column in a line
     We also need to change column cache --> as data model is depends on column cache

     Do we required column cache -> as it may lead to some problems ==> so we need to remove it if possible
        ==> for querying we may need to iterate column and then send them selves without using column cache
        ==>we can create two coluns for duration with visibility none so that they can participate in data model changes while saving
